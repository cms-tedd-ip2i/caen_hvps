#   Created: March 23 2020 - During the great plague
#   Purpose: Provide a higher level wrapper for the wrapped c-api provided by caen.py
#            If one is going to interface with the CAEN it should be via this wrapper layer
#            unless one needs direct access to the hardware which should be unusual.
# *************************************************************************************

# This is my low level wrapper for the actual C-Api

# HVPS_Channel
# Setup a class of objects that represent one channel on the HVPS
# This allows one to easily create a list of these objects which can represent all the
# channels on the HVPS
